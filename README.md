Superhero-pedia
Your challenge is to build a Superhero-pedia to find all the important information of your favorite Superhero (Both universes included and more). Using the Superhero API you will have access to all the available information regarding your favorite superheros and supervillians. The goal of this project is for you to have a working enciclopedia to consult on your heros; for this purpose you will need to:

Build a UI that best represent the content shown in a catalog. It does not have to have a specific design, but it should contain all the features described below.
The image describes some ideas you may use, but you are NOT required to follow them, this is just an idea of what you may want to do.
Build a backend server that will receive the call from the front end to display what is being asked. There should be 2 actions:
Next/Previous: As part of the UI, you should have a way of moving back or forward, this will just display one character at the time, following the numbering order that the API provides. If you reach the end of the list, you should continue on the other side (e.g if I am at position 1 and go back, I should go to the last element of the list and viceversa)
Search: You can search for a particular character based on its name. If the name does not exist, you should show an error screen but offer the option to go back to the beginning of your list.
Every Character display should include:
The image of the Character
ID
Name
Full Name
Powerstats
Place of birth
Small biography
Aliases (If any)
Gender
Race
Height
Weight
Eye-color
Hair-color
Group affiliation
Some of this things have multiple entries, so you can decide how you want to display them. (Suggestion: Look at the Bootstrap elements available and study the option of using them)

Suggestions:

Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
If any image is missing, make sure that you provide a default image so the design is not affected.
